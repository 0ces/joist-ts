The high-level goal of Joist is to bring [ActiveRecord](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html)-level productivity to TypeScript/Node projects.

This is a lofty goal, and Joist has just started down that road, but that is the standard Joist strives for and ideally can surpass.

The major goals are:

- Use [code generation](./code-generation.md) to move fast and reduce boilerplate
- Avoid [N+1s](./dataloader-integration.md) through first-class dataloader integration
- Make [loaded vs. unloaded collections](./type-safe-relations.md) represented in the type system
- Enable [great testing](./great-tests.md) with built-in factories and other support
- Internally have a [small & simple codebase](./small-codebase.md) to ease long-term maintenance concerns
